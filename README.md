This repository contains the code and documentation for an Ultrasonic Sensor Overfill Alert System designed for city waste bins. The system utilizes an ultrasonic sensor fixed to the top of the bin, which transmits data to a central processing unit (Firebase) for real-time monitoring and alerting.

Overview
The Ultrasonic Sensor Overfill Alert System aims to tackle the issue of overfilled waste bins in cities, providing an efficient way to monitor and manage waste levels. The system consists of the following components:

Ultrasonic Sensor: A non-contact sensor mounted on the top of the waste bin to measure the distance to the trash surface accurately.

Microcontroller: An Arduino or any compatible microcontroller reads data from the ultrasonic sensor and processes it.

Central Processing Unit: The system uses Firebase as the central processing unit to store and manage the sensor data. Firebase provides real-time data storage, enabling efficient monitoring and alerting.

Mobile/Web Interface: Users can access the waste bin status through a mobile or web-based interface connected to Firebase. The interface displays real-time data, alerts, and historical trends.

How It Works:
Ultrasonic Sensor Data: The ultrasonic sensor continuously measures the distance to the trash surface inside the waste bin. It sends this data to the microcontroller.

Microcontroller Processing: The microcontroller reads the data from the ultrasonic sensor and processes it to calculate the fill level of the bin. The calculated fill level is then sent to Firebase.

Firebase Data Storage: Firebase receives the data from multiple waste bins and stores it in real-time in a structured manner.

Monitoring and Alerting: The mobile/web interface connected to Firebase displays the current fill level of each waste bin. Administrators can monitor the waste levels of all bins remotely. The system generates alerts when a bin reaches a predefined threshold, indicating that it requires emptying.

Usage
To use this system in your city's waste management:

Set up the hardware by attaching the ultrasonic sensors to the bins and connecting them to compatible microcontrollers (e.g., Arduino).

Create a Firebase account and set up a new Firebase project.

Flash the microcontroller with the provided Arduino code (or compatible code) in this repository.

Integrate the mobile/web interface with the Firebase project to visualize and manage the waste bin data.

Deploy the system to your waste bins, and the central processing unit will handle real-time data storage and alerting.
